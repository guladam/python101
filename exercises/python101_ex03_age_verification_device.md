# problem #3

![terminal](images/terminal.png)
You work as an IoT expert for a tech company. There's been a lot of problems lately with underage students attending parties in a particular venue. The client had to cut budgets this year, so there isn't enough security to check for underage attendees.

As a solution, they made a deal with your company. You need to develop a terminal which scans and verifies the person's id with an image recognition algorithm. Assuming you already implemented the hardware part of the device, you still need to write the software interface which does the verification part.

In this venue, you can attend such parties if you already turned 18 or if you'll turn 18 later this year.

## task #1
Write a program that gets the current person's birth year from the standard input.

Then, print "PASS" or "FAIL" to the standard output according to the rules mentioned above.

an example run, in 2023:
```
Std. Input:	
ID scanning complete, year of birth: 2001

Std. Output:
PASS
```
