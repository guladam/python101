# problem #4

You need to write a function that generates a random integer number between a given range (*start* and *end*).

Your only way to generate random numbers is to generate a random real number from the \[0, 1\[ interval (0 included, 1 excluded).

## task #1
Write a function that that takes *start* and *end* integers as input and returns a random integer from that range (*start* and *end* included).

an example run:
```
Std. Input:	
start: 1
end: 6

Std. Output:
4
