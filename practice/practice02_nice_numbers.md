# practice task #3: nice numbers

According to an online article, there are some numbers which appear *nicer* to us than others. The criteria for the nice numbers are the following:

- it is only applicable to integers between 1 and 1000,
- they end with either a 5 or a 0

## instructions
Write a program that reads an integer from the standard input.
Print the appropriate message the standard output. There are 3 possibilities:

 - if the integer is out of the applicable range, print "incorrect input"
 - if the integer is inside the applicable range and is a *nice number*, print "nice number"
 - if the integer is inside the applicable range and is NOT a *nice number*, print "not a nice number"

an example run:
```
Std. Input:	
number: 25

Std. Output:
nice number
```
