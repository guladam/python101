# practice task #4: business profit

Mary works as a hairdresser and owns her own salon. She wanted some help from you calculating her expanses and revenue for the last year.

## instructions
Write a program that reads two integers from the standard input:

- the total amount of expanses of last year (in $-s),
- the total amount of revenue of last year (in $-s)

Print the appropriate message the standard output. There are 3 possibilities:

 - if the year was profitable, print "profit: \<PROFIT\>$"
 - if the year was unprofitable, print "loss: \<LOSS\>$"
 - if the year was neither profitable neither unprofitable, print "barely even"

an example run:
```
Std. Input:	
expanses in last year ($): 25000
revenue in last year ($): 30000

Std. Output:
profit ($): 5000
