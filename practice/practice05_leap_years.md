# practice task #5: leap years

You found a bug in your phone's Calendar app. For some reason, the developer of the application didn't take leap years into consideration. In leap years, we have an additional day in February, namely a 29th day.

You want the fix the bug by providing a piece of code which can determine if the given year is a leap year or not.

A year is a leap year if it satisfies the following conditions:

- it is divisible by 4, but not by 100,
- or it is divisible by 400

## instructions
Write a program the year as an integer from the standard input:
Print the appropriate message the standard output.

> leap year
> not a leap year

an example run:
```
Std. Input:	
year: 2012

Std. Output:
leap year
```
