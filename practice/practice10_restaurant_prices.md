# practice task #10: restaurant prices

You are working for a restaurant and your task is to write a program that generates the menu prices for the day. The dishes are provided by the chef but you need to take care of the pricing. The program should randomly select prices for each course (appetizer, entree, and dessert) and output them to the user.

The prices should be random but there are some restrictions:

- the total price needs to be *EXACTLY* 7000 HUF
- appetizers should cost between 1000 and 1500 HUF
- the entree should cost between 3000 and 5000 HUF
- desserts should cose between 1000 and 2000 HUF

> Extra tip: you can use *random.randint()* from the **random** module to generate the number.
